# MapPlayerView Refactoring Plan

## Overview
Refactor the monolithic MapPlayerView class (over 2000 lines) into smaller, focused components following Single Responsibility Principle and PEP8 guidelines.

## Identified Components to Extract

### 1. GameStateManager
- Handle game state initialization and management
- Manage game_manager, job_manager, score_system
- Handle save/load state operations
- Methods: `_initialize_game_systems`, `set_game_systems`, `_load_initial_jobs`, etc.

### 2. InputHandler
- Handle all keyboard and mouse input
- Manage key press/release events
- Handle movement, actions (P, E), navigation
- Methods: `on_key_press`, `on_key_release`, `on_mouse_press`, `_handle_undo`, etc.

### 3. UIManager
- Handle all UI drawing operations
- Manage HUD, panels, buttons, overlays
- Methods: `_draw_panel`, `_draw_hud_card`, `_draw_inventory_panel`, `_draw_undo_button`, `_draw_lose_overlay`, etc.

### 4. UpdateManager
- Handle game update logic
- Manage timers, notifications, player updates
- Methods: `on_update`, notification updates, weather updates, etc.

### 5. GameLogicHandler
- Handle game-specific logic
- Pickup/delivery logic, money management, job notifications
- Methods: pickup/delivery fallbacks, money sync, etc.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
- [x] Analyze MapPlayerView class structure
- [x] Identify logical components to extract
- [x] Create this TODO.md file

### Phase 2: Create New Component Classes
- [x] Create `game_state_manager.py`
- [x] Create `input_handler.py`
- [x] Create `ui_manager.py`
- [x] Create `update_manager.py`
- [x] Create `game_logic_handler.py`

### Phase 3: Refactor MapPlayerView
- [ ] Update MapPlayerView to use composition
- [ ] Remove extracted methods from MapPlayerView
- [ ] Add imports for new components
- [ ] Update __init__ to initialize new managers

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test game startup and basic functionality
- [ ] Test input handling (movement, actions)
- [ ] Test UI rendering
- [ ] Test save/load functionality
- [ ] Verify PEP8 compliance

### Phase 5: Cleanup
- [ ] Remove any duplicate code
- [ ] Update comments and documentation
- [ ] Final code review

## Benefits Expected
- Improved maintainability and readability
- Better testability of individual components
- Compliance with PEP8 and clean code principles
- Easier debugging and feature development
- Reduced cognitive load when working with the codebase

## Risks and Mitigations
- Potential breaking changes: Thorough testing required
- Import cycles: Careful dependency management
- Performance impact: Monitor and optimize if needed
